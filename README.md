This program processes PDF invoices from a specified directory, extracts relevant information, and compiles it into an Excel spreadsheet. The key functionalities include:

PDF Extraction: Extracts invoice details such as invoice number, payment method, date and time, coin amount, price, subtotal, Coinbase fee, and total amount using regex patterns.

File Management: Moves processed PDF files to a designated "Processed_Invoice" folder.

Data Compilation: Aggregates extracted invoice data into an Excel file, updating it with new information each time the program runs.

Excel Formatting: Adjusts column widths, applies styling to headers (dark blue with white text), and sets a gray background for data cells for better readability.

Overall, the program automates the extraction, organization, and storage of invoice data, ensuring a structured and easily accessible summary of all processed invoices.
